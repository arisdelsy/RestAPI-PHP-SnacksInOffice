# RestAPI-PHP-SnacksInOffice
 This is a small example of a REST API using simple PHP and no frameworks for the snacks that are kept in an office. The goal was to We keep track of the name, calories, quantity, type ( drink, chips, candy, fruit ), and whether that snack is located in the fridge ( bool ). We should be able to retrieve a list of the snacks in order of calorie count, and by type.
 
 The actual program is running on my AWS EC2 Apache Web Server instance. The database is also in an RDS AWS instance.

 Testing was done via Postman.
